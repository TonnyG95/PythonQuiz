## Testing

I manually tested the application using the following actions:

Passed the code in a code validator
Raised errors for invalid inputs, and looped the input until a valid input is entered
I tested it using my local terminal and the Code Institute Heroku terminal

## Bugs

### Solved bugs
User input valedation (User was able to skip typing the answer but if woud fail on checking answer)
My question and options were too long, I used lines breaks to fix this.
